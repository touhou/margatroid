A little HTML5 shoot-em-up about Alice and her dolls.

The game runs in your browser. Best played in Chrome; also works in Firefox and Opera. Internet Explorer will not work.

If you have trouble, try it without sound.

The game's characters - Alice Margatroid, Reimu Hakurei, Shanghai Doll - all come from Touhou. I do not own their copyright.

I created this game's graphics with Inkscape, music with LMMS, and sound effects with sfxr. Programming is done in the Coffeescript language, using the JQuery and Underscore libraries.
